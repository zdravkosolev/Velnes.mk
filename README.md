-Project goal is to create app for beauty salons, where clients can make appointments, see the salon reviews from other clients, see all information available for chosen salon(something like booking.com for beauty salons).

-This project is built in React, with TypeScript. For styled systems, that use styled-components.

-Client requirement was this app to be mobile only.

-My side of job was to build only frontend side. db.json is temporary solution until backend comes in.
